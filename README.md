# NBA Foul Project

## Introduction
This project is a Python-based data analysis initiative focused on sports analytics, featuring scripts for data collection and analysis, particularly in identifying trends in sports data. 
In this project, I analyzed historical NBA foul data over the past 20 years to identify any potential inconsistencies in the calling of fouls between home and away teams in the NBA.
